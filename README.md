# HealthScienceOER

#Hello! This dataset is an ongoing project aimed to index Health Science Open Educational Resources (OER) so that students, educators, clinicians, and the general public can more easily find free learning tools! There are so many Health Science OER materials scattered across the internet. My aim is to collect them all and to build a searchable website that people can use to sift through the resources I've found. Feel free to contribute to the list.

#Metadata includes: -Title -Authors -URL -Createive Commons Licensing -Material Type -Media Format -Topic -Notes including any login requirements -Keywords that will make the item findable once the search feature is built out
